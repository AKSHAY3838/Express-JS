for sending multiple requests we use & to differential between them
	we use & to separate query parameters, not spaces.
  	like http://localhost:5421/sum/?num1=100&num2=500




in URL if we live one whitespace it also consider as data  ( )= %20 
	for ex	http://localhost:5421/sum/?num1=100 &num2=50
		http://localhost:5421/sum/?num1=100%20&num2=50
	 *URL become invalid
	 URLs cannot contain spaces. This is known as URL encoding.
